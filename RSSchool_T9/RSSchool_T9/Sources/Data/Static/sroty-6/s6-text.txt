Cacti are perennial flowering plants belonging to the clove family.
The concept itself comes from the Greek word "kaktos", which was used to refer to unknown herbs and plants. The term "cactus" was first used in 1737 by the scientist Carl Linnaeus as an abbreviated form of melocactus. All plants with thorns and sharp needles were summed up under the latter term. Cactus (the plant's homeland - North and South America) is a real "pantry" of water and grows in various climatic conditions.

The history of the emergence of thorny plants is still shrouded in mystery. Scientists cannot find reliable facts, guided by exclusively logical assumptions. A feature of the etymology is the absence of the remains of ancient cacti that have not survived as a fossil. Even on Aztec bas-reliefs and rock paintings, plants were depicted, similar to modern varieties of cacti: melocactus, prickly pear and cereus. This similarity testifies that in the process of their evolution they have not undergone major changes. According to scientists, the cactus has existed for more than 50 million years.

The native land of the plant is the arid regions of North and South America. Over the course of many millennia, they have adapted to the peculiarities of climatic conditions and formed external signs. In the plant world, no analogues of these amazing plants have been recorded, which are capable of vegetating due to their own moisture reserves for 2 years. Particularly difficult is the period of adaptation of cacti in desert conditions, since the level of humidity in such an area is minimal. To reduce the consumption of their own moisture, plants grow over a strong leathery shell.
 
In the process of photosynthesis, they produce cell sap, which has a slimy structure. This viscous liquid helps plants maintain water balance and deprives them of the need for additional oxygen.
