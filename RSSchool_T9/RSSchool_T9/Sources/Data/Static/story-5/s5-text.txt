The history of the origin of the planet
According to the alleged version, Mars owes its origin to a collision with an asteroid.

After birth, he was under constant "bombardment" of asteroids and comets. The imprints of such battles are very clearly visible in the southern hemisphere of Mars. There you can see a huge number of pools and craters.

The mechanism for the origin of young surfaces due to the movement of tectonic plates, as it happens on our earth's surface, does not work on Mars.

The red planet does not have rocks like the Earth. All mountain formations are of volcanic origin. There are very high up to 27 km and young ones. This large growth is facilitated by less gravity and no plate movement.

Precisely because the earth's crust does not move, the mountains remain in their original state and are not destroyed.

Also on the planet Mars there are various valleys, according to some assumptions, these are dried up rivers.

Scientists imply that the planet used to have a higher atmospheric pressure. Thanks to this factor, the existence of water resources was possible on it, and having a low atmospheric pressure, water cannot be stored. It evaporates instantly.

Examining the compiled maps, you find valleys that resemble a river bed. Many of them are larger than the Amazon.
